/**
 * Seed script — populates (or refreshes) a demo account with realistic
 * interview history so the app looks genuinely used: varied roles, dates
 * spread across several weeks, a believable score progression, a streak,
 * and enough completed interviews to unlock most badges.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cd server
 *   node scripts/seedDemoData.js
 *
 * Safe to re-run — it wipes and regenerates ONLY the demo account's own
 * interviews each time, never touches real user data.
